# CodingInterviewPractice

##  What's the point  
This repository is meant to be a tool to help centralize interview problems for me and other students in my class.

## How you can help
Well, if you're a hiring manager checking out my github, test me on one of the problems I've already solved in this repository!
<br/>
If you're not a hiring manager but see a more optimal solution to any of the problems we've solved, I'd love to hear about it and understand why, so please submit a pr.

## Requirements for a pull requirest

It's not good enought to have a collection of answers, if you don't understand why the answer works, please don't submit a pr. 
<br/>
Feel free to answer the problem in the language that you feel most comfortable in. If a folder doesn't exist for your language, add one and place your file within the folder.
<br/>
Some of the problems can be grouped, check to make sure someone hasn't already started a file with similar problems.
Aside from that, happy coding and good luck.
