# CodingInterviewPractice

## Welp
I'm a senior and I spent all my time building things (cause it's fun, you know) and now I'm woefully unprepared for coding assessments so this is my repository of problems I'm working on
and I will continue to update it with as I build solutions in leetcode/hackerrank in preparations for my upcoming interviews. 

## How you can help
Well, if you're a hiring manager checking out my github, test me on one of the problems I've already solved in this repository!
<br/>
If you're not a hiring manager but see a more optimal solution to any of the problems I've solved, I'd love to hear about it and understand why, so please submit a pr.
